# Magist Partnership

*Insights from the Drop-Shipping Initiative and Market Analysis*

In February 2025, our team, as part of the Data Analysis Bootcamp at WBS CODING SCHOOL, took a close look at the planned collaboration with the drop-shipping provider Magist. The main question was whether a three-year partnership would be beneficial for Eniac to support the company’s market entry in Brazil.

## Background and Objectives
- **Basic Idea**: Analyze sales data, customer profiles, and product information to evaluate the feasibility and benefits of a three-year partnership with Magist.  
- **Client**: Eniac, represented by the (fictitious) CEO, required a well-founded recommendation for the expansion strategy in Brazil.  
- **Presentation**: The goal was to provide a decision-making aid within five minutes on whether the team recommends a collaboration with Magist.

## Technical Implementation and Tools
- **Database Management**: MySQL was used to query and evaluate the relevant datasets.  
- **Visualization**: Tableau Public helped present the findings in a clear manner. -- The corresponding workbook is available on my Tableau Public profile.

## Approach and Key Findings
The project allowed for an open view of the database to independently develop and answer questions. Building on a set of initial key questions, we delved deeper into the data, constantly uncovering new perspectives. The following focal points emerged, among others:

1. **Expanding the Lines of Inquiry**: Instead of merely processing the specified questions, the team was encouraged to develop and test their own hypotheses.  
2. **Teamwork and Learning Curve**: Within just one week of project time, it was impossible for individuals to handle all tasks alone. Effective collaboration was therefore crucial for the project’s success.  
3. **Focus Instead of Details**: By dividing responsibilities, we were able to formulate a concise recommendation without getting lost in irrelevant details.

## Challenges and Solutions
One of the biggest obstacles was recognizing that working together offers more benefits than tackling tasks single-handedly. Thanks to regular communication and a clear distribution of roles, all essential points were addressed in time. Only in this way could we arrive at an objective recommendation for the CEO.

## Personal Remarks
I am especially grateful to my teammates Marc and Özgün, who contributed to this success with perseverance and patience. Through this intensive collaboration, I not only learned valuable data analysis methods but also realized the significance of teamwork in a demanding project.

## Conclusion
The joint effort in data evaluation and the well-structured presentation enabled us to provide Eniac with a solid basis for deciding on the partnership with Magist. We demonstrated that focused analyses and close collaboration within the team can lead to a convincing result even in a short time.
